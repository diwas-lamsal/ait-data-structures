-- Because I was out of time by the end, I could not add the tests 

-- I was only able to add the one below which checks if the current student gets added (which itself is incomplete)

  test "should add current student to project" do

 -- I have, however, managed to get a code coverage of 100%
 
-- In my users.yml:

three:
  email: 'user3@example.com'
  is_student?: true
  confirmed_at: "2020-09-09 07:01:51.461869"
  
 
-- I also could not test the "Also be sure to test for the condition that when a non-student user is viewing a project,
--  he/she should not see the “add self to project” link/button." because of time.
